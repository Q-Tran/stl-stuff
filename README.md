Read in everything as a triangle. Match each triangle with its rectangles. So search for the same vertices and within the same plane
Therefore z must be the same, and two equivalent vertices.
This gives me the top and the bottom parallelograms.
match each top with its bottom by matching the same x and y for all four points.
average the 4 points that have the smallest surface area and then average the other 4 points together.
You then have 2 points to create the vector.
Go from a to b and repeat process for all the triangles/rectangle.
